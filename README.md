A single page ecommerce app for Rosengard Art and Ware.
Client will add products manually via REST/store.js and Stripe's portal for now.
Client's customers can shop as normal, are taken to a Stripe page on checkout, and returned to a confirmation or cancel page.
Client can use the admin link at the footer to login to view, update or delete messages submitted through the contact form.

Optimizations/TODO: Host stripe checkout on site so that order information can be stored and viewed in the Admin dashboard, which also needs to be password locked/authenticated. 
See components for more specific TODOs.
